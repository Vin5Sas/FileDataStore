#Freshworks Backend Assignment

The DataStore project has been created in a way that it satisfies all *Functional* and *Non-Functional* requirements specified in the Assignment Document.

**Note:** To let only **one user** instantiate the classes, the *FreshDataStore* class can be made a **Singleton Class**.

It has also been *assumed* that the data stored in *"value"* are **Name** of a person and their **Placement Status** (as a JSONObject). 
Any new attributes can be added to "value" JSONObject by changing it in *Value.java* file.
